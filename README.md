# Student Database Program

This is a simple student database program written in C. The program allows you to manage student records including adding, viewing, deleting, and checking the existence of student entries. It also provides information about the database's status, such as its current usage and whether it's full.

2. [Usage](#usage)
3. [Functions](#functions)
4. [Code Structure](#code-structure)

## Features
- Add new student records.
- View all student records.
- View specific student records by ID.
- Delete student records by ID.
- Check if a specific student ID exists.
- Get the list of all student IDs.
- Check if the database is full.
- Display the used size of the database.

## Usage
When you run the program, you will be presented with a menu with the following options:
1. Add an Entry
2. View Used Size in the Database
3. View All Student Data
4. Get All Student IDs
5. Search for a Specific Student by ID
6. Check if a Student ID Exists
7. Delete Student Data
8. Check if the Database is Full
9. Exit

## Functions

### `void INIT_SDB(student students[], int size)`
Initializes the student database with some predefined records and sets the remaining entries to empty.

### `int SDB_APP()`
Displays the main menu and takes the user's choice of action.

### `void SDB_action(int action, student students[], int size)`
Performs the chosen action from the menu.

### `void printAllStudents(student students[], int size)`
Prints the data of all students in the database.

### `void SDB_AddEntry(student students[], int size)`
Adds a new student entry to the database.

### `int SDB_GetUsedSize(student students[], int size)`
Returns the number of used slots in the database.

### `void SDB_GetList(student students[], int size)`
Prints the list of all student IDs in the database.

### `void printSpecificStudent(student students[], int size)`
Prints the data of a specific student by their ID.

### `int SDB_IsIdExist(student students[], int size, int id)`
Checks if a specific student ID exists in the database.

### `int SDB_delete(student students[], int size, int id)`
Deletes a student entry by their ID.

### `int SDB_IsFull(student students[], int size)`
Checks if the database is full.

## Code Structure
The project is divided into several files:

- `main.c`: Contains the main function and initializes the program.
- `SDB.h`: Header file containing the function prototypes and the `student` structure definition.
- `SDB.c`: Contains the implementation of all the database functions.
- `SDBAPP.c`: Contains the function for displaying the menu and getting user input.

## Running the Program
The program can be compiled with any modern version of GCC, or just using code blocks.
